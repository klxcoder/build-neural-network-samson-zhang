"""
Question: Why is n 785?
Answer: In the dataset, each row represents a digit image, and each image is 28x28 pixels (total 784 pixels). Each pixel's value is stored in a separate column. Additionally, thereâ€™s one extra column for the label (the digit itself).

So, n = 784 (pixels) + 1 (label) = 785.
